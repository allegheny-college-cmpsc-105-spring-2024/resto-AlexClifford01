### Reviewing Logan's Hot Dogs': 
I commend Logan for this website and his hot dog establishment. In some circles,
I am known as the "glizzy gulper" and appreciate the art of a good hot dog. I must say the hot dog is
quite interesting and rather tasty. A good glizzy indeed! However the fries are quite cringe and not
cool! Why are they so much cash? I don't know, but I do know that next time I will instead purchase 
two glizzies with the money I would use for fries. Also, Logan's Hot Dogs should sell my energy drinks
so that I can obtain more MONEY. They should get rid of their fries and replace them with my products.
Logan's Hot Dogs should also sell COLD dogs instead, because I think that would be pretty funny. One 
criticism I have of Logan's Hot Dogs is the reviews section, which contains reviews by rather suspect characters, with
names that may be fake. I think these reviews are FABRICATED, and that is not acceptable.
