The above plot tracks the amount of users over the past several weeks. 

Data on the amount of users is a big part of the google analytics dashboard. The amount of users is plotted against time on
multiple scales, one from day to day, and the other on the scale of minutes. New users to the website are noted.
The country of origin of users visiting the website is also noted, and visualized on a map of the world.
Views by page title and screen are tracked, so you can see which parts of the website users are interacting with.
All of this information may useful to an actual restaurant owner, because user data could reveal 
which parts of the website are attracting and keeping the attention of the most users. This should be
considered when trying to attract more customers, by either improving the less visited sections of the site,
or prompting visiters to the most popular sections of the website to make a reservation. User data could also show
what regions potential customers are from.
