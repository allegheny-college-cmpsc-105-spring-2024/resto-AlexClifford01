### Reviewing Stephen's Kool Restaurant: 
I commend Stephen for his website and fine dining establishment. My favorite item has got to be
raw meat. I am glad he specified it is from a cow! I do not have any ena so the only menu item 
I can currently purchase is the gruel, as I am capable of a crisp high five. The menu is aptly
titled, as it is indeed an amazing menu. The hours are quite peculiar and rather humorous I would say.
I plan to set my alarm for 1:00 on Sunday night so that I can show up to the restaurant on time.
I am the largest gruel fan to ever exist, so I will surely consume the gruel at the restaurant.
I recommend that the restaurant start selling meat (chicken) or meat (fish) as an alternative to meat (cow). 
This may attract more business I think. They should also sell my energy drinks so I can get more business.
This was a paid promotion of Kool Restaurant.
